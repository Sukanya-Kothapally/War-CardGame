Algorithm for playing a card game:
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

This algorithm distributes the cards shuffled randomly for two players.
Winner of the game is the Player who has all cards(either Player1 or Player2) according to the game rules.

1. Creating a list of suits and card faces
2. Creating a deck for each suit (2 Clubs, 3 Clubs,... etc)
3. Give a rank to each card in this deck(To compare which card is greater, as there are Alphabets)
4. Shuffle the deck and Divide the cards between 2 players.
5. Continue the below logic until cards in either of each player deck count is 0
    5.1 Each player will open each card from top
    5.2 Check rank of each card
        5.2.1  If rank of card drawn by the player is greater the that player adds all the cards drawn into his deck.
        5.2.2  If rank of card is same, check for the count of cards in each players deck if it is 0, then the game is Tie
        5.2.4  If the rank count of cards is not 0, draw the next cards and add the cards into a list.
        5.2.5  Compare the ranks of latest drawn cards and repeat the step 5 until the rank of highest card is returned.
    5.3 Add up all the cards in the list to the persons deck who has highest rank.
6. Player who has all the cards is the winner.

*********************************--------------------------------------------------------------*********************************
Cases/Assumptions:
1. As the cards faces are not only integers but also alphabets, giving the cards Ranks is the best way.
2. My comparisons are based on this rank as in who is the winner.
3. count of cards decides the winner.
